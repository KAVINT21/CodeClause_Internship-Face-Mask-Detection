# Face-Mask-Detection

This project focuses on detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using the MobileNetV2 architecture. The model is trained on a dataset of images containing individuals with and without face masks.

## Model Architecture and Training and Evaluation

MobileNetV2 is popularly used in various computer vision tasks, especially on mobile and edge devices, due to its lightweight nature. Some common use cases include:

Image classification
Object detection
Face recognition
Semantic segmentation
